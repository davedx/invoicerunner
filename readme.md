PLAN
====

Test plan
----

- Verify loginButtons register button is not bypassing our createUser method
- Test registration and upgrade validation
- Test upgrade works and adds correct subscriptions in Stripe
- Ensure user permissions work (can only edit own invoices)
- Test full workflow from upload to archive

Roadmap
---

1. Customisable email notifications (e.g. when an invoice is due in 3 days you get an email...)

2. Financial reports

3. Download/export archives

4. OCR module (2nd tier of pricing plan)

5. Email imports: get vendors to email your invoices to your_username@invoicerunner.com to import them

6. Generate and send invoices? (module) (highly debatable - a huge pivot?)

7. Localization (chinese, spanish, hindi)

8. Investigate compliance (regulatory examples): http://www.einvoicingbasics.co.uk/selecting-einvoicing/selecting-einvoicing-solutions/
